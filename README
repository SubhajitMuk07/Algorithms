This is just a collection of algorithms that I haven't yet had the chance to use in a work/school project and have decided to implement for the purposes of learning them.

The efficiency/correctness of anything here isn't going to be thoroughly tested so if you decide to use any code here for any reason, the author is not responsible for mistakes or bugs.
